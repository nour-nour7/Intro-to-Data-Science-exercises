OrderID

For question 5) i used claude to help with the subqueries, originally i used joins by doing: sqlite> SELECT ContactName                                                                 ...> FROM Customers
   ...> INNER JOIN Orders ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID
   ...> WHERE (SELECT COUNT(OrderID) FROM Orders WHERE CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID) = 31;

which worked but not efficiently as it repeated the name

this solution works better in my opinion : 

5)select ContactName from Customers where ( 
(x1...> select count(OrderID) from Orders where CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID) 
   ...> =
   ...> (select max(orders) from 
(x1...> (select count(OrderID) as orders from Orders group by CustomerID));
